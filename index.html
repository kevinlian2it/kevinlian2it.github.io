    <section id="about">
      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I’m currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with a minor in Economics at Columbia University, maintaining a 3.9 GPA and achieving Dean's List honors for four consecutive semesters. My academic focus is on AI and machine learning, areas where I’m passionate about leveraging technology to create innovative, real-world solutions.</p>
      <br>
      <p>In my current role as a Research Assistant at the <a href="https://sustainingpeaceproject.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sustaining Peace Project</a> at Columbia Climate School, I’m exploring the intersection of AI, natural language processing, and peace studies. This work involves analyzing vast datasets using NLP techniques and building a high-performance vector database for large language models, helping enhance research into sustainable peace. Previously, I interned at Yuzhi Technologies in Beijing, where I optimized ChatGPT prompts and performed data-driven market research, contributing to the successful launch of a health app with over 4,000 users within its first week.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Apart from my technical pursuits, I have a strong interest in Economics, which I study as a minor. This adds a valuable perspective to my work, especially in data analysis, as I consider economic impacts alongside technical solutions. Outside of academia and work, I’m an avid soccer fan and enjoy exploring diverse cuisines, always on the lookout for new flavors and experiences.</p>

        <h3>Research Assistant</h3>
        <p><em>Columbia Climate School, New York, NY | Oct 2023 – Present</em></p>
        <p>At Columbia Climate School, I applied AI and machine learning techniques, using NLP and vector embeddings to analyze linguistic patterns for peace research. I developed a high-performance vector database of 100,000+ news articles, integrating retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with large language models. I also presented research findings at events with 600+ attendees and contributed as first author to two research papers on AI and peace studies.</p>

        <h3>Intern</h3>
        <p><em>Yuzhi Technologies, Beijing, China | Jun 2023 – Aug 2023</em></p>
        <p>At Yuzhi Technologies, I optimized ChatGPT prompts with LangChain and Python, enhancing consumer application engagement. I conducted market research using Python data analysis libraries, contributing to product strategy, and played a key role in launching a health app for the elderly, achieving 4,000+ users in the first week.</p>
